My name is Breno Santos, I am 19 years old and I am from Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. \n\n Throughout my life, I have faced many challenges, but I have also achieved important milestones that fill me with pride. Among them, I managed to get a scholarship at an excellent school in my hometown, then a full scholarship to attend university and live in São Paulo and, more recently, I won an exchange spot for Belgium!\n\n These achievements are just a few chapters of my story. If you want to know more about my path, my dreams, and how you can be part of it, keep reading the topics below. I promise to tell you everything with an open heart.",

From a very young age, she taught me that studying can open doors that seem impossible to reach. And, even with difficulties, she always sacrificed herself so that I could have access to the best opportunities. Today, with a heart full of gratitude, I acknowledge her every effort. \n\n It was with my father, Rodrigo, an IT technician responsible for computer maintenance in our neighborhood, that I took my first steps into the world of technology, an area that, years later, would change the course of my life. \n\n And I cannot fail to mention my dear grandfather, Milton, who always believed in my potential. Even with the limitations of age and resources, he did everything in his power to support my growth. His love translated into small gestures, which deep down were always giant. \n\n And thanks to many others whom I could not thank in this small space, because my family is my origin, my foundation. Everything I have achieved so far has a piece of them.",

        "text": "My academic journey began turbulently. In the early years of elementary school, I studied at a public school in my neighborhood. I was very young, but I already felt the weight of exclusion. I suffered bullying from classmates and, what marked me most, even from teachers. I was placed at the back of the classroom, labeled as a 'dumb student,' because I had reading difficulties at that time. \n\n When my parents found out what was happening, they were outraged. With much effort and sacrifice, they gathered what they could and transferred me to a small private school in the same region. It was in this new school that something began to awaken in me: an interest in mathematics and an insatiable curiosity to learn subjects that caught my attention. And for the first time, I felt safer and more included in a place where I was welcome. \n\n That was the turning point. From then on, each step in my studies took on a new meaning: it wasn't just about tests and lessons, but about doing something that fascinated me.",

        "text": "At the new school, everything started to change. The boy who was once isolated at the back of the room was now a reference in mathematics. I started to be called by the teacher to help classmates with difficulties, and this awakened something transformative in me: the confidence that I could, indeed, learn and teach. \n\n But it was in 2017 that the real turning point happened. My mother, always believing in me, enrolled me in the selection process for the Ismart Project, a program that offers scholarships to high-potential young people with few opportunities. After a rigorous five-stage process, with over 14,000 candidates and only 20 available spots... I was approved! \n\n With that, I won a full scholarship to study at the best private school in Belo Horizonte. An opportunity that, without this project, would never have been within my reach and that marked the beginning of a new phase in my life. \n\n It was there that my dream of transforming my reality truly began to take shape.",

The people around me lived a very different reality from mine, which made everything even more intense. \n\n For two years, I studied in two schools at the same time, woke up early to go to one, had a quick lunch, and took the bus alone every day to the city center, only returning home late at night. It wasn't much different in high school, which could be even more intense. \n\n It was a tough routine, but full of purpose. All this sacrifice was worth it: I made many friends, matured, and discovered new opportunities. One of them was the knowledge olympiads, where I had the joy of winning three gold medals and an honorable mention.",

In the third year of high school, I reached my limit: I had classes from Monday to Saturday, left home at 4:30 AM, and only returned after 7 PM. Every week there were tests, in addition to Enem simulations that tested not only my knowledge but also my emotional resilience. \n\n Honestly, there were moments when I thought I couldn't take it anymore. But all this sacrifice was recognized: I was accepted directly from high school to university, with a full scholarship. This allowed me to move to São Paulo and study at one of the best technology universities in the country, Inteli. \n\n At the time, even having to leave everything I knew behind and face a new city, totally different and far from home, I was ready to embrace the world. I faced this new phase alone, but with courage, willingness, and the same fighting spirit that brought me here. More than ever, I decided to chase another transformative opportunity.",

In addition, I took on the directorship of Human Resources in a student entity, where I could apply in practice everything I have been learning about leadership and people management. \n\n I also had the opportunity to participate in events at the offices of the world's largest companies, such as Google and Amazon, being recognized as a future leader in programs like LALA (Latin American Leadership Academy), Ismart, and Fundação Estudar. Each of these experiences reinforced my purpose and showed me that I am on the right path.",

My performance was so outstanding that, unlike most students, I was able to choose my destination, something rare, as the university usually defines it. \n\n Among options like Myongji in South Korea, Saxion University in the Netherlands, and Thomas More in Belgium, I chose Belgium because I believe it will be the ideal environment for my development as a professional and considering my maturation. \n\n However, although I managed to get a scholarship that covers the tuition fees of the host university, the other costs, such as housing, food, and transportation, are still a barrier. Therefore, I am seeking support to make this dream possible. More than a trip, this exchange is a chance to transform my future and, with your help, it can become a reality.",
